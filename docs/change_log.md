# Change Log

Running history of behavior-changing work, newest first. Each entry is a dated `## YYYY-MM-DD`
heading followed by a bulleted list of what changed (and why, where it's not obvious). When you
make a behavior-changing commit, add a bullet under today's date — create a new heading at the
**top** of the file if there isn't one yet for today. Don't rewrite or delete past entries.

## 2026-07-10

- Added `typecheck` (`tsc --noEmit`) and `test` (`jest`) npm scripts alongside the existing
  `start`/`ios`/`android`/`web`/`lint`.
- Added `jest.config.js` (jest-expo preset, mirrors the transform-ignore setup needed for
  `@supabase` and `react-native-url-polyfill`, `passWithNoTests: true` since the repo has no
  test files yet) and `jest.setup.js` (AsyncStorage mock).
- Ignored `.superpowers/` in `.gitignore`.
- Rewrote `CLAUDE.md` from a bare `@AGENTS.md` include into the full project doc: what this is,
  architecture at a glance, commands, secrets & env, git etiquette, code conventions, testing,
  and keep-these-docs-updated.
- Extended `AGENTS.md` with the pinned-SDK note (Expo SDK 54, `expo ~54.0.34`) and the rule
  that an SDK upgrade must update the versioned-docs link in the same commit.
- Added `docs/change_log.md`, `docs/status.md`, and `docs/architecture.md` to give future
  sessions persistent, accurate project memory — using V2.3's own milestones (M1–M7, from
  `planning/02-product-requirements.md`), not V2.2's.
- Repaired `.env`. `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` had lost its `KEY=`, leaving the line
  with no `=` at all, so dotenv skipped it and the key never loaded — the Supabase client would
  have thrown on first import. Also deleted the two dead `EXPO_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_*_CLIENT_ID`
  placeholders: the browser OAuth flow keeps Google's client ID and secret in the Supabase
  dashboard, and no source file reads them. Verified via `npm run lint`, whose loader output now
  exports both Supabase vars and no Google vars. Because `.env` is gitignored, this entry is the
  only record of that change.
- Rewrote `AGENTS.md` into an agent routing map. All 70 subagents in `~/.claude/agents/` are now
  mapped to the task each one owns, grouped by phase (plan / build / design / verify / test /
  ship / config), with read-only agents marked `°`. Routing rows point back at `CLAUDE.md`'s
  rules rather than restating them, so the two can't drift. The pinned-SDK note stays as the
  opening section; the file is held to 100 lines.
- Added a "How much process to run" tier table to `AGENTS.md`. Severity, not file count, decides
  how many steps run: Trivial edits go straight in, Small edits get `verifier` and stop, and any
  change to auth, RLS, payments, uploaded media, edge functions, schema, or the `analyze-form`
  flow runs the full plan → build → verify → review → docs chain **even as a one-file diff**.
  Small work stays inline because spawning a subagent is the expensive path — it starts cold and
  re-derives context the session already has.
- `CLAUDE.md` now says what its bare `@AGENTS.md` include actually pulls in: the routing map, and
  that the rules in `CLAUDE.md` bind every agent it names.
