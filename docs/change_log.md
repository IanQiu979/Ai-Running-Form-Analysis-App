# Change Log

Running history of behavior-changing work, newest first. Each entry is a dated `## YYYY-MM-DD`
heading followed by a bulleted list of what changed (and why, where it's not obvious). When you
make a behavior-changing commit, add a bullet under today's date — create a new heading at the
**top** of the file if there isn't one yet for today. Don't rewrite or delete past entries.

## 2026-07-11

- Executed Phase 0 of `docs/mvp-build-prompt.md` ("Reconcile before building anything"),
  committing the previous session's layer (the knowledge files, the `docs/design/` brief, and
  the build prompt itself) and closing the decision gate.
- **Ian answered the five remaining decision-gate items:**
  - Fallback/quota (#4): a validation-failed analysis becomes an honest, clearly-labelled
    partial result only when ≥2 pillars parsed, otherwise a clean failure; failures and
    fallbacks never burn quota (the atomic reserve is released), capped at 3 free retries per
    period against prompt-injection farming.
  - The numbers (#5): max clip length 15s; frames analyzed per tier — Free 1 / Pro 5 / Elite 8;
    max upload size 50MB pre-compress.
  - App name (#6): **"Pace AnalysisAI."** Repo/directory keeps the "V2.3" codename internally.
  - Apple Developer timing (#7): build email + Google sign-in in M1 now; add Sign in with Apple
    the moment an Apple Developer account exists, before TestFlight review.
  - Consent & privacy (#8): a one-line consent notice before first upload plus a Settings
    disclosure ship in v1; the full privacy policy and App Store privacy labels are tracked for
    M7, not dropped.
- Renamed the app in `app.json` to match decision #6: `name` "Pace AnalysisAI", `slug`
  `pace-analysis-ai` (dots removed — the previous slug was illegal), `scheme` "paceanalysisai",
  `ios.bundleIdentifier` and `android.package` both `com.ian.paceanalysisai` (follows V2.2's
  `com.ian.*` precedent).
- Synced all 14 rulings from `docs/mvp-build-prompt.md` §0-B into `planning/README.md`,
  `planning/01-brainstorm.md`, `planning/02-product-requirements.md`,
  `planning/03-engineering-requirements.md`, and `docs/architecture.md`: frames-only media
  pipeline (`media_path text` → `media_paths text[]`, direct-to-bucket upload, no video ever
  stored), the atomic reserve/settle quota RPC replacing count-then-insert, the idempotency-key
  design, the frame-sampling spec (5%–95% window, actual timestamps, ≤1568px/q≈0.7 downscale),
  V2.2's purchase-anchored quota-period arithmetic with Free as lifetime, the new
  `delete-account` edge function, the corrected Sonnet 5 model config (explicit thinking,
  4–8k `max_tokens`, forced tool call), the `{ error, code }` error contract and the
  `FunctionsHttpError`-unwrapping client note, the corrected 4-source-files-to-3-targets
  knowledge mapping (`drills.md` sourced from `ECHO_Framework_CORRECTED.md`, not
  `training_zones.md`/`workout_library.md`, which have zero drills), and the V1 ground-truth
  corrections (real enforcement lives in `anthropic-coach`, not `lib/subscription.ts`; V1 video
  "analysis" was one thumbnail at t=1s; V1 never persisted results).
- Updated `docs/status.md`: Known Issues #1 (app name) and #2 (illegal slug) marked resolved;
  #3 (Apple) records the timing decision; #9 (storage) updated to reflect frames-only retention.
  "Next action" now points at Phase 1 (the spine, M1) since the decision gate is fully closed.
- **Executed Phase 0.5 (the design layer) via four parallel agents**, closing its gate:
  - `ux-copywriter` → `docs/design/copy-deck.md`: the full copy deck — every screen state,
    permission rationales, the consent line, quota captions, and the disclaimer wording the
    brief called for but didn't fully write out.
  - `design-system` → rebuilt `constants/theme.ts` from the brief's §2 tokens (light+dark,
    score-band palette, spacing/radii/type scales), added `constants/contrast.ts`, and added
    `constants/__tests__/theme-contrast.test.ts` — a 61-assertion Jest proof every text/surface
    and band pair clears WCAG AA. **9 of the brief's intent values needed adjustment** to pass
    (darkened or lightened minimally); each old → new value is recorded inline in `theme.ts`
    next to the token it changed, not repeated here. Installed the three font families
    (`@expo-google-fonts/archivo`, `inter`, `ibm-plex-mono`) via `npx expo install`, which
    auto-added the `expo-font` plugin to `app.json`.
  - `motion-animation` → `docs/design/motion-consult.md`: confirmed every motion in brief §6 is
    implementable on the already-installed Reanimated/gesture-handler stack (no new
    dependencies) and specified the gaps the brief left open (wait-state pacing, reveal
    triggers, reduced-motion mapping) as binding spec for `frontend-builder`.
  - `privacy-compliance` → `docs/privacy-checklist-m7.md`: a ranked MUST/SHOULD privacy and
    compliance checklist gating M7 (App Store privacy labels, consent upgrade, data inventory,
    retention limits), which surfaced two new decisions for Ian, added to `docs/status.md` as
    Known Issues #10 and #11: (a) `knowledge/injury_flags.md` assumes a user-supplied free-text
    injury/pain note that has no field or screen anywhere in `planning/02` or the design brief —
    ship it (a new health-data channel needing its own consent + label) or drop it for MVP,
    decide before M3/M4; (b) no dollar figure exists anywhere for the Pro/Elite paywall, needed
    before M5.
  - Also fixed a dangling cross-reference in `docs/design/frontend-design-brief.md` screen 6:
    it cited "build prompt Ruling 15" for the Retry/Cancel-must-never-trap-the-user rule, but
    the build prompt's rulings end at 14. Replaced the citation with the rule stated inline.
- `CLAUDE.md`'s Secrets & env section's media bullet was corrected to frames-only wording
  (extracted frames are what's stored; the full-resolution video never leaves the device).

## 2026-07-10

- Added `typecheck` (`tsc --noEmit`) and `test` (`jest`) npm scripts alongside the existing
  `start`/`ios`/`android`/`web`/`lint`.
- Added `jest.config.js` (jest-expo preset, mirrors the transform-ignore setup needed for
  `@supabase` and `react-native-url-polyfill`, `passWithNoTests: true` since the repo has no
  test files yet) and `jest.setup.js` (AsyncStorage mock).
- Ignored `.superpowers/` in `.gitignore`.
- Rewrote `CLAUDE.md` from a bare `@AGENTS.md` include into the full project doc: what this is,
  architecture at a glance, commands, secrets & env, git etiquette, code conventions, testing,
  and keep-these-docs-updated.
- Extended `AGENTS.md` with the pinned-SDK note (Expo SDK 54, `expo ~54.0.34`) and the rule
  that an SDK upgrade must update the versioned-docs link in the same commit.
- Added `docs/change_log.md`, `docs/status.md`, and `docs/architecture.md` to give future
  sessions persistent, accurate project memory — using V2.3's own milestones (M1–M7, from
  `planning/02-product-requirements.md`), not V2.2's.
- Repaired `.env`. `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` had lost its `KEY=`, leaving the line
  with no `=` at all, so dotenv skipped it and the key never loaded — the Supabase client would
  have thrown on first import. Also deleted the two dead `EXPO_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_*_CLIENT_ID`
  placeholders: the browser OAuth flow keeps Google's client ID and secret in the Supabase
  dashboard, and no source file reads them. Verified via `npm run lint`, whose loader output now
  exports both Supabase vars and no Google vars. Because `.env` is gitignored, this entry is the
  only record of that change.
- Rewrote `AGENTS.md` into an agent routing map. All 70 subagents in `~/.claude/agents/` are now
  mapped to the task each one owns, grouped by phase (plan / build / design / verify / test /
  ship / config), with read-only agents marked `°`. Routing rows point back at `CLAUDE.md`'s
  rules rather than restating them, so the two can't drift. The pinned-SDK note stays as the
  opening section; the file is held to 100 lines.
- Added a "How much process to run" tier table to `AGENTS.md`. Severity, not file count, decides
  how many steps run: Trivial edits go straight in, Small edits get `verifier` and stop, and any
  change to auth, RLS, payments, uploaded media, edge functions, schema, or the `analyze-form`
  flow runs the full plan → build → verify → review → docs chain **even as a one-file diff**.
  Small work stays inline because spawning a subagent is the expensive path — it starts cold and
  re-derives context the session already has.
- `CLAUDE.md` now says what its bare `@AGENTS.md` include actually pulls in: the routing map, and
  that the rules in `CLAUDE.md` bind every agent it names.
- Fixed "can't open the project in Expo Go". Root cause: `expo-dev-client` is a dependency, so
  `expo start` defaults to a development build and advertises
  `exp+v2.3-photo-video-analysis://expo-development-client/?url=…` — a deep link Expo Go cannot
  open. Nothing was wrong with the network or the phone. Added a `start:go` script
  (`expo start --go`), which serves `exp://192.168.x.x:8081` and reports "Using Expo Go";
  verified by running it. Pressing `s` in the dev server does the same thing at runtime.
  `expo-dev-client` was deliberately kept — a dev build is still the right target for Android and
  for any future custom native module.
